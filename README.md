# Binary Trees

This repository includes a collection of functions for working with binary trees, created as part of a binary tree project. The functions cover a range of binary tree operations and provide practical solutions for managing and manipulating binary trees.

## Functions Overview

1. **0-binary_tree_node.c**: Creates a binary tree node.
2. **1-binary_tree_insert_left.c**: Inserts a node as the left child of another node.
3. **2-binary_tree_insert_right.c**: Inserts a node as the right child of another node.
4. **3-binary_tree_delete.c**: Deletes an entire binary tree.
5. **4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c**: Checks if a node is a leaf.
6. **5-binary_tree_is_root.c**: Checks if a node is the root.
7. **6-binary_tree_preorder.c**: Performs pre-order traversal of a binary tree.
8. **7-binary_tree_inorder.c**: Performs in-order traversal of a binary tree.
9. **8-binary_tree_postorder.c**: Performs post-order traversal of a binary tree.
10. **9-binary_tree_height.c**: Measures the height of a binary tree.
11. **10-binary_tree_depth.c**: Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.
12. **11-binary_tree_size.c**: Measures the size of a binary tree.
13. **12-binary_tree_leaves.c**: Counts the leaves in a binary tree.
14. **13-binary_tree_nodes.c**: Counts nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.
15. **14-binary_tree_balance.c**: Measures the balance factor of a binary tree.
16. **15-binary_tree_is_full.c**: Checks if a binary tree is full.
17. **16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c**: Checks if a binary tree is perfect.
18. **17-binary_tree_sibling.c**: Finds the sibling of a node.
19. **18-binary_tree_uncle.c**: Finds the uncle of a node.

This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for binary tree operations and can be used as a resource for learning and implementing binary tree structures and algorithms.
